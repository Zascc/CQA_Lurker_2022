            "content": "Let’s start with what bitcoin is? Bitcoin is a digital currency created in January 2009 following the housing market crash. It follows the ideas set out in a whitepaper by the mysterious and pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. The identity of the person or persons who created the technology is still a mystery. Bitcoin offers the promise of lower transaction fees than traditional online payment mechanisms and is operated by a decentralized authority, unlike government-issued currencies. There are no physical bitcoins, only balances kept on a public ledger that everyone has transparent access to, that – along with all Bitcoin transactions – is verified by a massive amount of computing power.

Despite it not being legal tender, Bitcoin charts high on popularity, and has triggered the launch of hundreds of other virtual currencies collectively referred to as Ripple. Etc. Bitcoin is powered by a technology called a blockchain. To understand Bitcoin, you must understand a little bit about the technology in order to make a wise choice for your investment strategy. A blockchain is a public database that shows all transactions, with user privacy protected by “cryptography”. There are many types of blockchains, and many types of coins. Since Bitcoin was created, there have been hundreds of more coins brought to the market, many of which are cheaper, faster, and more efficient. For example, Litecoin processes at 56 transactions per second. Newer faster blockchains like EOS can process hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. In terms of utility, Bitcoin only processes 7 transactions per second. So you may be wondering, why is the price of Bitcoin so high? There are lots of reasons, such as the fact that it was the first coin, it has brand recognition, and you can use to buy services on some internet websites. But other coins like Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash are catching up. Why Invest in Bitcoin? It seems silly to some people that one bitcoin can be worth thousands of dollars. What makes bitcoins valuable? Bitcoins Are Scarce Let’s look to gold as an example currency. There is a limited amount of gold on earth. As new gold is mined, there is always less and less gold left and it becomes harder and more expensive to find and mine. For this reason, along with Gold’s millenia-long history as a medium of exchange, it has long been considered a hedge against monetary inflation. “Gold is a very under-owned asset, even though gold has become much more popular. If you ask any central bank, any sovereign wealth fund, any individual what percentage of their portfolio is in gold..., you'll find it to be a very small.... It's...imprudently small..., particularly at a time when we're losing a currency regime.” Ray Dalio, Legendary Hedge Fund Manager The same is true with Bitcoin. There will only be 21 million Bitcoins, and as time goes on, they become harder and harder to mine. Take a look at Bitcoin’s inflation rate and supply rate: and harder to mine.

            "content": "The “too late” mindset will ruin your investing psychology and your potential to make enough money to enjoy your life. Bitcoin has gone mainstream. There are some people who hate me for it. I’m getting quite a few people all asking me the same question: “Is it too late to invest in bitcoin?” I don’t think it is. Bitcoin is a paradigm shift in a world that is high on worthless currency printed in excess. The only way to fund our excessive lifestyles is to increase the global debt and pay for it with money printed out of thin air. My approach to bitcoin is different. It’s a little less drastic. I’ve been playing with it for years and have become fascinated by it. The rewards for me understanding bitcoin are now over 17,900%+ on the initial investment. I don’t think I’ve ever made another investment like it. It’s likely I will never make another investment like it for the rest of my life. There may never be another investment like it. The unfortunate psychological challenge when you buy something that performs beyond your wildest dreams is you think to yourself, “I should have bought more.” You can always want more and spend more. But it doesn’t matter. Money has never made me happy. The same is likely true for you. So how do you manage your psychology when bitcoin mania is sweeping the world and it has gone mainstream? How do you cope when it’s trending on twitter, on the front page of every newspaper, being promoted by some of the biggest wall street tycoons in the world, like Paul Tudor Jones? First, you stay calm. You’re never late to anything in life. You’re right on time. What bitcoin has done to date is irrelevant. If you haven’t bought any or don’t understand it then that’s not the issue. The issue is whether you are openminded enough to rethink everything you know about money and investing. If you are, there is opportunity. If your mind is closed, the world is closed, and so are the opportunities. When I first heard about bitcoin , I thought it was a joke. I made fun of my work colleagues who were buying a sandwich with half a bitcoin and loving life. Bitcoin is extremely weird The trouble with bitcoin is it’s not easy to understand.

Over the past months, the price of bitcoin has been hovering around $9,283.87. It seems silly to some people that one bitcoin can be worth hundreds of dollars.

As new gold is mined, there is always less and less gold left and it becomes harder and more expensive to find and mine. The same is true with Bitcoin.

This mean you can easily turn a few hundred dollars into a few thousand dollars with enough increase in demands.",

Over 100,000 merchants worldwide now accept bitcoin. The number of active wallet addresses on the Bitcoin network continues to grow – a key sign of a vibrant and growing financial ecosystem – while the methods for sending, receiving, and storing bitcoins continue to improve at both the consumer and institutional levels.",

What if someone put their whole life savings into Bitcoin in December 2020 and then desperately needed the money in May 2021? They would have lost a whopping percentage of their life savings!",
                "If you don’t have enough money in savings to cover emergency expenses, you shouldn’t buy Bitcoin.If you don’t have healthcare, you shouldn’t buy Bitcoin.If you have a large and expected expense coming up, you shouldn’t buy Bitcoin.If you are not emotionally stable, you shouldn’t buy Bitcoin.If you can’t buy Bitcoin and hold onto it for years even though it’s losing value, then you shouldn’t buy Bitcoin."

                "remember when Elon musk said he would accept bitcoins for tesla. well we know he had a large dash of bitcoins already, after he dropped the news that the value of the coin shoots up he sells them all. DING DONG DITCH then he announces they won't accept bitcoin anymore the price falls he buys back in.",
                "and remember when he said dogecoin was great and it shot up in value. LOL dogecoin isn't even a real cryptocurrency, I mean it's a joke based off real cryptocurrency. it can be infinitely reproduced so it has actually no value but if people buy it up faster than its mine, then its value increases. elon musk knows this so he bought a lot of dogecoin, values goes up and then sell, repeat the cycle and make profit now it. these were stocks this would be incredibly illegal and get musk in deep trouble but coins aren't protected again they're decentralized so market manipulation is super easy",
                "With time I learned that, you don't matter shit to society, they only care whether you have money or not, you can be completely evil, but provided you have money, society will blindly follow you, and they'll think you're doing whatever good for the world. The world only cares about money and the power it holds, society has only one reason to make something popular, whether it makes money or not. They don't care whether the good is useful or not, or if it is harmful to its users, they only care whether you can make money with it.",
                "you clearly cannot make money with fediverse or XMPP, heck even with real decentralization. You cannot because there's no boss, there's no master. Only us trying to make the internet actually free and private for all. And as we are making services for the greater good of people rather than for profit, we are not making any money with this.",
                "It's true that some people have made money, a lot of money with cryptocurrency but for all the stories of people who made a lot of money, the stories you don't hear about are people who have lost a lot of money.",
                "people that want to make money will place the idea, the concept in cloud 9, because they need this, they need you, and they need you to be used in an awful way. You'll have random people screaming at you about how great this is, because they want you to be the one that pools money in and loses.",
                "you'll eventually realize the utopian ideals of this stuff is so unrealistic and how its based off a fallacy. It's all about speculation. it's about making money without really making anything.",
                "Yes maybe you can make the illusion of money with that fake centralization Blockchain proposes, it is a fake decentralization because, if someone, for example, bans you, it's recorded in the blockchain that you're banned, so you can't do shit, you can't say \"alright, I'll create a new account\" which is not different from getting banned from Twitter and creating a new account. So it's still the same, in real decentralization, if you get banned, you just create an account in other server and that's it (Or you can create your own server!). With blockchain this is not possible, you'd have to create your own blockchain, which will be separated from the blockchain you were using before, it's like going from Twitter to something like Gab.",
                "and please shut the gag about the whole but, bitcoin is decentralized, its not sweetie, its not. None of the cryptocurrencies are truly decentralized. They’re actually centrally controlled by the miners, who can basically rewrite history at will. They made people believe that what they're using it's actually decentralized, but in practice, it's exactly as centralized as Twitter and similar.",
                "It doesn't help that there is an industry built around promoting this. If you see somebody online talking about making a lot of money in cryptocurrency, it's safe to assume they don't know how to do it because if they did, they would be spending their time and resources with cryptocurrency instead of trying to sell some PONZI scheme on the Internet.",
                "People don't realize that the market for cryptocurrency is controlled by the people who have a lot of it. These people are referred to as “WHALES.” If somebody wants to liquidate a large quantity of bitcoins, because the market is relatively small, it will depress the price to the point where equilibrium is eventually reached. The fate of the market is directed by the big players.",
                "Bitcoin blocks take forever to compute. Literally, a transaction takes 10 minutes to an hour to compute and verify! And it’s not getting better, it’s getting worse because BitCoin was set up to have increasingly difficult mine operations. cryptocurrency's value is derived from nothing it's unlocked through meaningless computations that don't have any correlation with work or any basis beyond creating",
                "But why would people change to blockchain despite the fact it's exactly the same shit? many have said once cryptocurrency stabilizes then it can be used as a proper means of transactions like it won't be jumping around this much, but SURPIRSE SURPRISE, that may never happen since it would require equivalent of trillions of us dollars spent by people using just a single cryptocurrency on actual goods not speculative markets and that can't happen you know unless it's already stable because businesses won't accept a speculative coin. it won't be used for trading because it's not stable and it won't be stable because it's not used for trading.",
                "it's exactly the same shit. When they banned Trump from Twitter and shit, people started thinking \"Alright, centralization is bad, we need decentralization\". So, instead of going for the real decentralization (XMPP, Fediverse...) They went for the shit \"decentralization\", Projects like bitcoin, solana, ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, Veil and Harmony and God knows what else.",
                "And again, why did they choose the shit decentralization instead of the real decentralization? Because with Blockchain and shit, you can make money, you can't with the other kind of decentralization. But something even better is that CEOs can keep their users happy while having the same control over users, because, again, it's one blockchain per network, if you're banned from one blockchain, you have to go to another or join the same blockchain again.",
