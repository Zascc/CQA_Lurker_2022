If I was in the position of never being near a self-driving car, or one with driver assistance features (like my car currently has), then yes, I would be pretty nervous to ride in a self-driving car if one suddenly plopped down in front of me. At a bare minimum I would want to see a lot of data that shows statistics like how often they are involved in accidents, or probably get a lot of anecdotal stories from friends and other early adopters on how their experiences went. However, I am lucky enough to be in a position where I have a car (a Tesla Model 3) that has driver assistance features such as adaptive cruise control and lane keeping/changing that are evolving over time, and just like having ridden as a passenger with my teenage sons who were learning to drive, and being quite nervous at times, I’ve had the opportunity to see how the car has gradually improved, while staying alert and ready to take control if needed. The first time I let the car steer for itself, and brake for itself, I was very nervous, and I took control often. But over time, the car earned my trust and I got to know when it would start to brake. That’s not to say I’m ready to cede control 100%. Autopilot still has a long way to go before it’s “self-driving”. But I have to say, it really does do a great job in highway driving situations. It’s probably safe to say that it’s probably better than I am in those situations, but I still have to be alert for situations that may be difficult for it. I think the real test is this: would I feel comfortable enough in a true self-driving car to fall asleep and take a nap while the car is driving. I think eventually I will get to that point. But I think that point’s still a long way off.",
