## Abstract
In Community-Based Question Answering (CQA) platforms, people
can participate in discussions about non-factoid topics by mark-
ing their stances, providing premises, or arguing for the opinions
they support, which forms “collective arguments”. The sustainable
development of collective arguments relies on a big contributor
base, yet most of the frequent CQA users are lurkers who seldom
speak out. With a formative study, we identified detailed obstacles
preventing lurkers from contributing to collective arguments. We
consequently designed a processing pipeline for extracting and
summarizing augmentative elements from question threads. Based
on this we built CoArgue, a tool with navigation and chatbot fea-
tures to support CQA lurkers’ motivation and ability in making
contributions. Through a within-subject study (N=24), we found
that, compared to a Quora-like baseline, participants perceived
CoArgue as significantly more useful in enhancing their motivation
and ability to join collective arguments and found the experience
to be more engaging and productive.
